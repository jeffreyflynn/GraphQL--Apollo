This repo is to help me - and anyone else who may derive value from it - better understand GraphQL and Apollo.


1. Install dependencies.

    * `apollo-server` --- allows you to define the shape of your data and how to fetch it
    * `graphql` --- used to build schemas and execute queries on those schemas
